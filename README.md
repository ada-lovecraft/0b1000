The `0b1000` Principles
==========================

## Radical Inclusion
Anyone may be a part of The Coding Train. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community. However, that does not mean there is a lack of consequences for your actions, be they positive or negative

## Helping
The Coding Train Collective is devoted to acts of helping and artistic inspiration and expression. The value of help and encouragement is unconditional. Helping does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value (this includes receiving help and encouragement in return).

## Open Source-ness
In order to preserve the spirit of intellectual progress, our community seeks to create contemplative and interesting environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience. This community huddles around the an idea that one brilliant idea begets another. Every single new mind we bring to The Coding Train Collective is one more opportunity to be astounded and further educate yourself by all of those fuzzy-logic humans around you.

## Radical Self-Reliance
The Coding Train Collective encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources. Ask for help, but be ready to read documentation and experiment with code, document your process wether it be via comments, blog posts, video updates, or simply sharing with your fellow Trainees.

## Radical Self-Expression
Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.

**In other words:**
> *"Eight words The Coding Train fulfill: If it harms none, do what you will"*

## Communal Effort
Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.


## Participation
Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.

## Immediacy
Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a digital world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.
